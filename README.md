# Building highly available systems with Elixir: an introduction

We have all seen computer systems failing, sometimes in a mundane way, sometimes
in a catastrophic way. How can we reduce the probability of such failures to
happen? What makes a system fault tolerant?

In this tutorial, we will explore how Elixir answers these questions and what
makes it particularly well-suited to build highly available systems. We will
provide a quick introduction to the language and its runtime, the Erlang VM.

Participants will then be invited to work on a series of tapas. Tapas are small
projects with a challenge to be solved meant to introduce and illustrate some
fundamental aspects of Elixir and its runtime.
